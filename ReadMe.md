# Smart Note

Smart Note is an efficient note-taking application. This repository contains two main folders:

- **Application**: The source code for the client-side application.
- **Server**: The source code for the backend server that handles data storage and synchronization.

## How to Access the Folders
1. **Application Folder**:
   - Navigate to the `application` folder in the repository to find the source code for the client-side application. 
   - Here, you'll find the files needed to run the app on your device.

2. **Server Folder**:
   - Navigate to the `server` folder to find the source code for the backend. It handles the logic for data management and interaction with the database.
